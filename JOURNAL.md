## 10/21/2025 - Early design sketches  

- Designed/sketched very early hardware and functional schematics of launcher
- Clearly laid out goals and design components
- Next sketch will specify size constraints & measurements and materials for manufacturing![entry1.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDI1MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--44cad1cf6bfce3180255d96d56b90b4292afa1d8/entry1.jpg)

  

## 11/4/2025 4:10 PM - 1st Prototype Design Sketch  

- Finalized the design for the launcher and made a sketch with corresponding measurement values
- Identified clear material and measurement choices to translate sketch into real life
- Next step will be to translate this sketch into a Computer Aided 3D Design

## 11/4/2025 4:14 PM - Completed the 3D Computer Aided Design on Autodesk Fusion  

- Utilized Autodesk Fusion to create a 3D Design of our initial Sketch of the launcher
- Ensured precision in measurement and material choice (PLA) through the 3D Model to allow for correct dimensions in 3D printing
- Next step will be to 3D Print and test the launcher.![3DDesign](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODQwMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4229313beeae929d1a570a9de8291a389386e085/3DDesign.jpg)
