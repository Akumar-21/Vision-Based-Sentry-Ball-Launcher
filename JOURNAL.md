## 10/21/2025 - Early design sketches  

- Designed/sketched very early hardware and functional schematics of launcher
- Clearly laid out goals and design components
- Next sketch will specify size constraints & measurements and materials for manufacturing![entry1.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDI1MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--44cad1cf6bfce3180255d96d56b90b4292afa1d8/entry1.jpg)

  

## 11/4/2025 4:10 PM - 1st Prototype Design Sketch  

- Finalized the design for the launcher and made a sketch with corresponding measurement values
- Identified clear material and measurement choices to translate sketch into real life
- Next step will be to translate this sketch into a Computer Aided 3D Design

## 11/4/2025 4:14 PM - 1st Prototype 3D Computer Aided Design on Autodesk Fusion  

- Utilized Autodesk Fusion to create a 3D Design of our initial Sketch of the launcher
- Ensured precision in measurement and material choice (PLA) through the 3D Model to allow for correct dimensions in 3D printing
- Next step will be to 3D Print and test the launcher.![3DDesign](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODQwMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4229313beeae929d1a570a9de8291a389386e085/3DDesign.jpg)
  

## 11/5/2025 - Testing 1st Prototype of Ball Launcher  

- Tested ball launcher for various success factors such as ball launch distance, durability(snapping and breaking), and practicality(hole spacing)
- With testing we determined that the first prototype had many flaws that prevented its success, some of which include a high level of fragility in the connector piece in which the 3D print snapped
- Additionally, the first prototype had issues with practicality and implementation as the hole spacing was incorrect on the 3D Design, specifically on the connector piece which lead to an instable launcher as a unit.
- The next step is to resolve these issues on Autodesk Fusion to create the 2nd Prototype![1stprototype](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODc3NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ee2569a0ea23b81b1e1e55f669ebf989b3043084/1stprototype.jpg)
